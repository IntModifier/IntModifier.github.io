At the time of writing the catalog lists over four hundred sessions spread out across multiple session types, level and focuses. While you cannot build your scheduled yet, that is slated to open on July 16th. For now, you can go through and start to favorite sessions you want to attend. I would highly recommend starting to go through the catalog to give you ample time to browse and save yourself a lot of time when the scheduler opens.</description>

It has been quite a while since I last sat down to write a blog entry, and while quite a bit has changed for me both personally and professionally in 4 years, I still look forward to VMware Explore every year.</description>
